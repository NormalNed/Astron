# Astron Project
_A Server Technology for Realtime Object Networking_

Astron is an open-source, distributed server suite particularly well-suited for powering MMO games.
The design is inspired by a similar unrelated project developed at the Disney Interactive Media
Group, and used in-house from 2001 until 2013.

# üî® Building
Below you will find anything you need to know.

## üíª Windows

#### Dependencies
You will need to, of-course, clone the repository. After you have the repository you will need to download and build Astron's dependencies. See the building readme for instructions.

#### Preparing the VS Project
Currently, Astron only supports Visual Studio 2013 and above.

Preparing Astron for VisualStudio requires CMake. It is recommend to use the cmake-gui. (Download from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)

Under Where is the source code: Enter the path to your clone of Astron.

For Where to build the binaries: it is recommended to use a directory outside of the repository like **<ASTRON_PATH>/../build or ../AstronBuild.**

Then, hit **Configure** followed by **Generate** button.

#### Compiling
Using Visual Studio, open the solution generated by CMake at wherever you set your build path. You should then be able to build the solution with VS. By default, the keyboard shortcut for building the solution is the F7 key.

To build Astron for release, change the build type to Release from within Visual Studio.
For developing with Trace and Debug messages, set it to Debug.
For development without extra messages, set it to RelWithDebInfo.

## üêß Linux

```bash
cmake . && make
```
